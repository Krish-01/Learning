> cassandra.bat file also helps you to run Cassandra as a Windows Service. You just need Commons Daemon Service Runner Windows binaries.
You will need to create a folder named daemon under the bin directory and extract the correct version (32/64 bit) of prunsrv.exe to this directory (bin\daemon).
Run command prompt and change directory to the bin. 
Type:
cassandra.bat install

Then run services.msc command to see cassandra(yes, lowercased) as a Windows Service.
